# BRG-27-labs

Welcome to my BRG-27 lab journal! This repository documents my 4-day hands-on journey exploring Linux systems, cloud computing, automation, and secure web server deployment.

## 🗓️ Overview of the 4-Day Lab Series

Over the course of four intensive lab sessions, I worked through practical tasks that reflect what real IT professionals do in the field — from installing Ubuntu and setting up firewalls to launching cloud servers and writing automation scripts.

Each day is documented in a separate file:

- **Day 1: Linux Setup & Services**
  - Ubuntu installation on VirtualBox/VMware
  - Basic terminal commands and navigation
  - Apache web server, SSH, and UFW firewall setup

- **Day 2 Services, Cost, and Scripting**
  - AWS EC2 setup
  - Apache and TLS configuration
  - Bash scripting and introduction to cron jobs

- **Day 3 DNS, Certificates**
  - Domain registration and DNS setup (`jiakshimi.space`)
  - Let’s Encrypt TLS certificate via Certbot

- **Day 4  Automation**
  - Bash backup automation and remote file transfer (SCP)

## 📄 What You’ll Find Here

- Reflective answers to key questions from each lab
- Screenshots and code snippets to show progress
- Automation scripts and cron job samples
- Markdown-based documentation for learning reference

## 💬 Summary

This lab helped me build confidence in using Linux, setting up servers, securing web applications with HTTPS, and automating tasks using Bash. It gave me a practical foundation in system administration, cloud platforms, and DevOps tools — skills that are highly relevant to real-world IT roles.
